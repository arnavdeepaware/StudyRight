  "gemini_analysis": "Here's a breakdown of the linked list concepts for your educational video:\n\n- Title: What is a Linked List?\n  - Explanation: A linked list stores data in nodes. Each node holds data and a pointer to the next node, unlike arrays.\n  - Visual: A diagram showing three boxes (nodes) in a row. Each box has a number inside (data) and an arrow pointing to the next box. The last box's arrow points to null.\n  - Voiceover: \"Imagine a chain of connected boxes. Each box holds information and a pointer to the next box in line. That's a linked list!\"\n\n- Title: Singly vs. Doubly vs. Circular\n  - Explanation: Linked lists come in different flavors! Singly linked lists go forward, doubly go both ways, and circular link back to the start.\n  - Visual: Three diagrams side-by-side: (1) Singly: arrows point in one direction. (2) Doubly: arrows point in both directions. (3) Circular: the last arrow points back to the first.\n  - Voiceover: \"Linked lists have types: singly, doubly and circular. Singly goes one way, doubly goes back and forth, and circular connect to the start!\"\n\n- Title: Adding Nodes to a Linked List\n  - Explanation: We can add nodes to the beginning (head) or end (tail) of a linked list. Inserting at the head is super fast!\n  - Visual: An animation showing a new node being inserted at the beginning of a linked list, shifting the other nodes over. Then, show a node being added at the end of the list.\n  - Voiceover: \"Want to add a node? You can add it to the front or the back. Adding to the front is really quick!\"\n\n- Title: Removing Nodes\n  - Explanation: You can delete nodes from a linked list by finding the node and updating the previous node's pointer to skip the deleted node.\n  - Visual: A linked list diagram. An animation shows a node being removed from the middle, and the arrow from the previous node now pointing to the node after the removed one.\n  - Voiceover: \"Deleting a node involves finding it and then updating the pointer to skip over it, removing it from the list.\"\n\n- Title: Time Complexity: How Fast Are Linked Lists?\n  - Explanation: Adding to the beginning of a linked list is O(1), while other operations like search are often O(n), which can be slower.\n  - Visual: A table comparing the time complexity of different linked list operations (insertion at head, tail, deletion, search, traversal). Use color-coding to highlight fast (green) vs. slow (red) operations.\n  - Voiceover: \"Linked lists are fast in some operations, especially when adding to the beginning. But other common things, like searching, can take longer.\"\n\n- Title: Linked List Advantages and Disadvantages\n  - Explanation: Linked lists are flexible in size and good at inserting nodes, but accessing specific elements isn't as fast as in arrays.\n  - Visual: A split screen. One side shows the benefits of a linked list (dynamic size, efficient insertion). The other shows drawbacks (no direct access, extra memory).\n  - Voiceover: \"Linked lists are flexible and good at adding and removing, but accessing specific data is harder than in things like arrays. There is always a trade off.\"\n\n- Title: Where Are Linked Lists Used?\n  - Explanation: Linked lists are used in stacks, queues, browser history (doubly-linked), memory management, music playlists, and more.\n  - Visual: A montage of icons or short clips representing different use cases: a stack of plates, a queue of people, browser back/forward buttons, memory allocation blocks, a music playlist.\n  - Voiceover: \"You might not realize it, but linked lists are everywhere! They're used in stacks, queues, your browser history, managing memory, and even your music playlist.\"\n"
