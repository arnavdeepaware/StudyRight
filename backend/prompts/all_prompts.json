  "extracted_text_preview": "Insertion Sort4\n4.1 Insertion Sort\nThe problem of sorting is deﬁned as:\nIInput:nintegers in array A[1::n]\nIOutput:Asorted in increasing order\nHere we present Insertion-Sort , which is an eﬃcient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.\nInsertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and\nthe cards face down on the table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the\ncorrect position in the left hand. To ﬁnd...",
  "gemini_analysis": "**1. Title: Insertion Sort Explained!**\n**Caption:** Learn the basics of Insertion Sort, a simple sorting algorithm! #algorithms #computerscience #sorting #insertionsort #coding\n**Visual:** Animation showing how Insertion Sort works, highlighting the element being inserted and the shifting of other elements.\n**Voiceover:** \"Ever played cards? Insertion Sort is like arranging a hand! You pick a card and insert it into the right spot in your sorted hand. That's basically it!\"\n\n**2. Title: Insertion Sort: The Card Game Algorithm**\n**Caption:** Insertion Sort explained with playing cards. A simple way to visualize the process!\n**Visual:** A person sorting playing cards in their hand, demonstrating how each card is inserted into its correct position.\n**Voiceover:** \"Imagine you're sorting a hand of cards. You pick one up, compare it to the others, and slide it into the right spot. That's Insertion Sort! It's great for small, nearly sorted datasets.\"\n\n**3. Title: Loop Invariants Demystified (Insertion Sort Edition)**\n**Caption:** Loop invariants are your friends when proving algorithms! #loopinvariants #algorithms #coding #computerscience\n**Visual:** Text overlay: \"Loop Invariant: A[1..j-1] is always sorted\" with an arrow pointing to the sorted portion of an array being sorted by Insertion Sort.\n**Voiceover:** \"Proving your algorithm works? Use Loop Invariants! For Insertion Sort, the subarray to the left is *always* sorted. Initialization, maintenance, termination - that's the key!\"\n\n**4. Title: Insertion Sort Correctness: Initialization**\n**Caption:** Loop Invariant Proof Step 1: Initialization!\n**Visual:** Close-up shot of the beginning of the array (index 1) with emphasis on the fact that a single-element array is considered sorted. Text: \"A[1..0] - Empty, therefore sorted!\"\n**Voiceover:** \"First, does our invariant hold at the start? For insertion sort, before the loop starts the subarray A[1..j-1] is technically empty, or A[1..0]. An empty array is by definition sorted, so the invariant holds!\"\n\n**5. Title: Insertion Sort Correctness: Maintenance**\n**Caption:** Loop Invariant Proof Step 2: Maintenance!\n**Visual:** Visual of array being sorted, with emphasis on the shifting of elements to the right to create space for the correct insertion. Text overlay: \"If A[1..j-1] is sorted before, is A[1..j] sorted after?\"\n**Voiceover:** \"If our invariant is true at the beginning of the loop, is it still true at the *end* of the loop? The insert part of the code preserves the sortedness!\"\n"
