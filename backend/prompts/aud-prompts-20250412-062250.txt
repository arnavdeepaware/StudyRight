"The Bloomberg interview involves a few key stages. First, you'll have a phone screen. Then, if that goes well, you'll proceed to a virtual onsite, followed by further assessments by managers."

"The phone screen is your first chance to shine. It's all about showing off your coding skills *and* explaining your thought process clearly. So, practice, practice, practice!"

"The onsite dives deep into your technical abilities. Expect coding challenges and questions about designing systems from the ground up."

"Don't stress about writing perfect code immediately. Show them how you think! Explain your steps, even if you don't have all the answers right away."

"Before jumping into system design, always clarify the requirements. Understanding the problem fully is half the battle."

"Bloomberg expects you to know data structures and algorithms. Arrays, linked lists, trees, graphsâ€¦brush up on those fundamentals!"

"LeetCode and HackerRank are your friends! Use them to practice coding problems and get comfortable with the testing environments you might encounter in the interview."
