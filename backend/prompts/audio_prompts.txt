# Main Memory: Bytes and Bits
Think of your computer's main memory like a giant grid. Each cell holds a tiny piece of information called a bit, represented by 1 or 0. Eight of these bits make a byte.

# Memory Addresses: Finding Bytes
Each byte has its own special address, just like your house! The computer uses these addresses to quickly find and use the data stored there.

# Words: Groups of Bytes
Sometimes, the computer needs to work with larger chunks of data. It combines pairs of bytes into 'words,' which are twice the size.

# Coding Integers: Two's Complement
Since computers only understand 0s and 1s, they need a special code to represent numbers, including negative ones. That code is called Two's Complement.

# Coding Characters: ASCII and Unicode
But what about letters and symbols? Computers use coding schemes like ASCII or Unicode. Each character gets a unique number that the computer can store.

# Machine Language: Instructions for the CPU
The CPU only understands one language: machine language! Programs are essentially lists of instructions written in machine language, which the CPU can directly execute.

# Volatile Memory: Remember, It's Temporary!
Main memory is fast, but it's temporary. When you turn off the computer, everything in main memory is erased. That's why we need storage drives!
