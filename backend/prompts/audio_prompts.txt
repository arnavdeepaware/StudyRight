# Main Memory: Bytes and Bits
Think of your computer's main memory like a massive grid. It's made up of bytes, and each byte has 8 bits. Each bit can be either a one or a zero.

# Memory Addresses: Finding Bytes
Every byte has an address, like a house number, starting from zero. This allows programs to quickly find and use the data stored in specific memory locations.

# Words: Groups of Bytes
Sometimes, we need to work with groups of bytes together. These pairs are called 'words'. So Bytes 2 and 3 would make one word in Memory.

# Encoding Data: From Numbers to Bits
Computers only understand zeros and ones. So, we use special 'codes' like two's complement to turn numbers and letters into binary for storage.

# ASCII and Unicode: Character Codes
Characters also need to be encoded. Common systems are ASCII, using one byte per character, and Unicode, which uses two, allowing for many more character possibilities!

# Machine Language: CPU Instructions
The CPU understands machine language, which is a sequence of instructions represented by bytes. Different CPUs can have different machine languages.

# Volatile Memory: The Data Vanishes
Main memory is volatile, which means when you turn off your computer, all the data in main memory is lost. That's why we need other storage like hard drives!
