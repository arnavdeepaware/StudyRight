# What is a Linked List?
Imagine a chain of connected boxes. Each box holds information and a pointer to the next box in line. That's a linked list!


# Singly vs. Doubly vs. Circular
Linked lists have types: singly, doubly and circular. Singly goes one way, doubly goes back and forth, and circular connect to the start!


# Adding Nodes to a Linked List
Want to add a node? You can add it to the front or the back. Adding to the front is really quick!


# Removing Nodes
Deleting a node involves finding it and then updating the pointer to skip over it, removing it from the list.


# Time Complexity: How Fast Are Linked Lists?
Linked lists are fast in some operations, especially when adding to the beginning. But other common things, like searching, can take longer.


# Linked List Advantages and Disadvantages
Linked lists are flexible and good at adding and removing, but accessing specific data is harder than in things like arrays. There is always a trade off.


# Where Are Linked Lists Used?
You might not realize it, but linked lists are everywhere! They're used in stacks, queues, your browser history, managing memory, and even your music playlist.
