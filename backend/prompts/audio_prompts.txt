Arrays? So last year! Linked lists are where it's at! Think of them as a chain of data... where each piece knows where the next piece is hiding! Dynamic, baby!


# Section 2: Linked List Types: Choose Your Adventure!
Not all linked lists are created equal! Singly linked lists go one way. Doubly? They go both ways! And circular? They go round and round! Choose wisely, young padawan.


# Section 3: Linked List Basic Moves!
Alright, let's get down to business. Head insertions? Easy! Tail insertions? A little trickier. Deletions and searches? Consider it handled! Linked lists: versatile AND efficient!


# Section 4: Node Structure: The Building Block!
Meet the Node! This little guy holds your data and a pointer to the next Node. It's the secret ingredient to the Linked List magic!


# Section 5: Linked List Time Complexity: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
Speed matters! Some linked list operations are lightning fast, others... not so much. Know your time complexities to avoid a code slowdown!


# Section 6: Linked List Use Cases: More Than You Think!
Linked lists aren't just theoretical! They power stacks, queues, your browser history, and even your music playlists! Mind blown!
