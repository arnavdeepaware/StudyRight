# Section 1: Linked Lists: Not Your Grandma's Chain Letters!
Ever heard of linked lists? ⛓️ They're like arrays, but with *pointers*! Find out why they're so flexible! #datastructures #linkedlist #computerscience #coding #programming

Animated chain of nodes (boxes) visually linking together, with arrows indicating the "next" pointer. One box dramatically pulls away from the chain.


# Section 2: Linked List Types: Choose Your Adventure!
Singly, Doubly, Circular...🤯 So many linked lists! Which one is right for your project? 🤔 #linkedlist #singlylinkedlist #doublylinkedlist #circularlinkedlist

Three distinct visual representations of the different linked list types (Singly, Doubly, Circular) with labels.


# Section 3: Linked List Basic Moves!
Adding? Deleting? Searching? Linked Lists got you covered! 😎 #linkedlist #datastructures #codinglife #insert #delete #search

Short animated clips showcasing each basic operation (insertAtHead, insertAtTail, deleteNode, search) on a linked list.


# Section 4: Node Structure: The Building Block!
Ever wonder what makes up a linked list? Here's a sneak peek at the building block! 🧱 #linkedlist #nodes #python #codingbasics

A Python code snippet of the Node class with highlighted data and next pointer sections.


# Section 5: Linked List Time Complexity: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
Insertion: ⚡️ Fast! Searching: 🐌 Slow! Time to learn the time complexities of Linked Lists. #bigO #timecomplexity #linkedlist #efficiency

A table or graphic showing the time complexities of common Linked List operations (Insertion at Head - O(1), Insertion at Tail - O(n), Deletion - O(n), Search - O(n)). Use emojis to visually represent the time.


# Section 6: Linked List Use Cases: More Than You Think!
Stacks, Queues, Browser History?! Linked Lists are everywhere! Where else do you see them being used? #linkedlist #applications #coding #datastructures

A montage of images representing different use cases: a stack of pancakes, a queue of people, a browser window with back/forward buttons, and a music playlist.
