# Section 1: Insertion Sort Explained!
Learn the basics of Insertion Sort, a simple sorting algorithm! #algorithms #computerscience #sorting #insertionsort #coding

Animation showing how Insertion Sort works, highlighting the element being inserted and the shifting of other elements.


# Section 2: Insertion Sort: The Card Game Algorithm
Insertion Sort explained with playing cards. A simple way to visualize the process!

A person sorting playing cards in their hand, demonstrating how each card is inserted into its correct position.


# Section 3: Loop Invariants Demystified (Insertion Sort Edition)
Loop invariants are your friends when proving algorithms! #loopinvariants #algorithms #coding #computerscience

Text overlay: "Loop Invariant: A[1..j-1] is always sorted" with an arrow pointing to the sorted portion of an array being sorted by Insertion Sort.


# Section 4: Insertion Sort Correctness: Initialization
Loop Invariant Proof Step 1: Initialization!

Close-up shot of the beginning of the array (index 1) with emphasis on the fact that a single-element array is considered sorted. Text: "A[1..0] - Empty, therefore sorted!"


# Section 5: Insertion Sort Correctness: Maintenance
Loop Invariant Proof Step 2: Maintenance!

Visual of array being sorted, with emphasis on the shifting of elements to the right to create space for the correct insertion. Text overlay: "If A[1..j-1] is sorted before, is A[1..j] sorted after?"
