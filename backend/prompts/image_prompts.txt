# Main Memory: Bytes and Bits
A split screen: On one side, show a magnified view of a computer chip with glowing lights representing bits (1s and 0s). On the other, show a series of bytes visually represented as small boxes.

# Memory Addresses: Finding Bytes
A numbered grid representing memory locations. Highlight specific cells as the voiceover mentions addresses.

# Words: Groups of Bytes
Highlight two adjacent bytes in the memory grid and visually combine them into a single, larger unit labeled "Word."

# Encoding Data: From Numbers to Bits
Show an integer (e.g., "42") transforming into a binary representation (e.g., "00101010"). An arrow points from the integer to the binary representation.

# ASCII and Unicode: Character Codes
Show a table comparing ASCII and Unicode. Visually represent the difference in the number of characters each can represent. For example, ASCII table, then a much larger Unicode table.

# Machine Language: CPU Instructions
Simple animation showing a sequence of bytes being "read" by a CPU. Show those Bytes being converted to CPU instructions.

# Volatile Memory: The Data Vanishes
A memory chip fading out as a power cord is unplugged. The bits (1s and 0s) disappear.
