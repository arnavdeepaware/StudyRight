# Main Memory: Bytes and Bits
An animation showing a memory chip. Zoom in to show bytes, then zoom further to show individual bits represented as 1s and 0s.

# Memory Addresses: Finding Bytes
A numbered list representing memory addresses (0, 1, 2, 3...). Highlight a specific address and show data being accessed from that location.

# Words: Groups of Bytes
Show bytes with addresses 2 and 3 grouped together, highlighting them as a single "word." Label the combined bits as "16 bits."

# Coding Integers: Two's Complement
Show an example of a decimal number (e.g., -5) being converted to its two's complement binary representation (a sequence of 0s and 1s).

# Coding Characters: ASCII and Unicode
A table showing examples of characters (A, B, C, etc.) and their corresponding ASCII or Unicode values. Briefly contrast the size (1 byte vs 2 bytes).

# Machine Language: Instructions for the CPU
Show a simplified representation of a machine language instruction as a sequence of bytes.

# Volatile Memory: Remember, It's Temporary!
An animation showing data disappearing from a memory chip when a power cord is unplugged.
