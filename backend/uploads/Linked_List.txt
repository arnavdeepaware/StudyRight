# Linked List

What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:

Data
A reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence
Unlike arrays, elements are not stored in contiguous memory.

🧱 Types of Linked Lists

Type	Description
Singly Linked List	Nodes have pointer to the next node only
Doubly Linked List	Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
Circular Linked List	The last node points back to the first node
🧠 Basic Operations (Singly)

Operation	Description
insertAtHead()	Add node at the beginning
insertAtTail()	Add node at the end
deleteNode()	Remove a node (by value or position)
search()	Find a value in the list
traverse()	Visit all nodes from head to tail
🧪 Node Structure (Python)

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
📊 Time Complexity (Singly)

Operation	Time Complexity
Insertion at head	O(1)
Insertion at tail	O(n)
Deletion (by value)	O(n)
Search	O(n)
Traversal	O(n)
🔄 Advantages

Dynamic size (no need to define size upfront)
Efficient insertions/deletions at the head or middle
⚠️ Disadvantages

No direct access to elements (unlike arrays)
Extra memory for storing pointers
📦 Use Cases

Implementing stacks and queues
Navigating browsers (forward/back history with DLL)
Managing memory allocation
Polynomial arithmetic
Music/video playlist structures
🧪 Example: Traverse a Linked List

def traverse(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.data, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")
