Microeconomics – Notes

✅ What is Microeconomics?

Microeconomics is the study of individual decision-making units in an economy — like households, firms, and industries — and how they interact in specific markets.

It focuses on supply & demand, price formation, consumer behavior, and firm production.

🧠 Core Concepts

1. Demand
Law of Demand: As price ↓, quantity demanded ↑ (inverse relationship)
Demand Curve: Downward sloping
Shift Factors: Income, preferences, prices of related goods, expectations
2. Supply
Law of Supply: As price ↑, quantity supplied ↑ (direct relationship)
Supply Curve: Upward sloping
Shift Factors: Input costs, technology, taxes/subsidies, expectations
3. Equilibrium
Where quantity demanded = quantity supplied
At this point, market clears (no surplus or shortage)
👤 Consumer Behavior

Utility:
Satisfaction from consuming goods
Total Utility: Total satisfaction
Marginal Utility: Extra utility from one more unit
Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: MU ↓ as consumption ↑
Indifference Curves:
Show combinations of goods giving equal satisfaction
Downward sloping, convex to origin
🏭 Theory of Production & Costs

Short Run vs Long Run:
Short run: At least one fixed input
Long run: All inputs variable
Law of Diminishing Returns:
Adding more of one input (keeping others fixed) leads to less additional output
Costs:
Type	Definition
Fixed Cost (FC)	Does not vary with output
Variable Cost (VC)	Changes with output
Total Cost (TC)	FC + VC
Average Cost (AC)	TC / Output
Marginal Cost (MC)	∆TC / ∆Output
📦 Market Structures

Market Type	Features
Perfect Competition	Many buyers/sellers, identical products, price takers
Monopoly	One seller, high barriers, price maker
Monopolistic Comp.	Many sellers, product differentiation, some price control
Oligopoly	Few sellers, interdependent, possible collusion
💸 Elasticity

Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):
Measures how much quantity demanded responds to price change
